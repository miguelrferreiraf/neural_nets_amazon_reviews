This project involves some basic step-by-step command lines we can find in any **machine learning** algorithm but that still can show us how powerful is the standard paradigm of machine learning algorithms. 

We are going to use the average well known protocol of **machine learning** that is basically the loading of some data and the cleaning and model application upon it. We may use a tokenizer also. Then, we are going to save the model.

## Neural Networks
For this type of work, we may use **Neural Netwoks**, that are specially apt for abstract works. Although it may not be the most efficient model for some works that involve numerical analysis, it’s very useful for works like calligraphy recognition, disease prediction, playing chess etc. We may use the LSTM model of layers and neuron  arrangement. That’s the basic structure:

## Tokenizer

The **tokenizer** is absolutely necessary for this algorithm. Tokenizer is a technology that allows the classification of parts of the text as strings with a semantic value that may be used for the neural network training. It’s a module that permits the creation of lexical  scanner. Since the most important part of the algorithm is the reading by the **Artificial Intelligence** we must use it.
